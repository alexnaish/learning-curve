# Learning Curve

The aim of this project is to allow the gradual building of knowledge via a mixture of theory and practical exercises with the end goal of building a solid foundation.

There will be parts where you get stuck, don't understand a term or a concept. Half the battle of software engineering is conquering the fear of not knowing and simply having a go until you do. Nobody has perfected programming, its constantly evolving and as such what you read one month may be obsolete by the next!

The contents of this course is heavily opinionated and you may disagree (or come to disagree) with aspects of it. I welcome that kind of input because as I mentioned previously, nobody has perfected software engineering and nobody should ever think that what is the "best" way to do something now will always be so.
