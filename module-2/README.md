# Module Two - Programming Principles

Programming isn't something that can ever be classed as "learnt" in my opinion. Sure, you can learn all the syntax and you can learn all the functions that can be called on an object but that doesn't now mean you're an expert programmer. I like to think of programming as a form of problem solving - you have something that needs to happen and you need to break it down into chunks and then "fix" it one step at a time.
