# Module One - World Wide Web

## History

The internet was inspired and formed from the work of a military project called ARPANET in the 60s. At the height of the Cold War, military commanders were seeking a computer communications system without a central core, with no headquarters or base of operations that could be destroyed - causing the network to be taken out instantly. As more academic facilities connected to it, the network did take start to take on the distributed structure the military had imagined. The Internet essentially retains that form, although on a much larger scale. The first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from a computer at the University of California to a second network node at Stanford Research Institute.

In the 1980s, research at CERN in Switzerland by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee resulted in the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, accessible from any node on the network.

The usage of the internet continues to increase year on year, especially with the growth in the "[IoT](../GLOSSARY.md#iot)" market and social media. As consumer usage grows, media becomes higher resolution and websites become "richer", the bandwidth requirements to consume this increases and technologies need to cater for this. The days where you were excited if you could download an mp3 in under 20 minutes - its now expected to have a seamless (and preferably instantaneous) response.
